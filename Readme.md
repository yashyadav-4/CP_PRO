🚀 CPPro: Competitive Programming Analytics DashboardCPPro is a centralized, high-performance dashboard built for competitive programmers who want to stop grinding blindly and start growing strategically. By aggregating data from platforms like Codeforces, CPPro provides deep insights into your solving patterns, topic mastery, and contest performance.✨ Key Features🛠 Core AnalyticsThe "Upsolve" Bucket: Automatically tracks problems you failed during contests and puts them in a "To-Do" list. Growth happens in the problems you couldn't solve.Topic Mastery Progress: Visual levels for tags like DP, Graphs, Greedy, and Math. Level up your skills from "Newbie" to "Master."Speed vs. Accuracy Analysis: A scatter plot analyzing how long you take to solve problems versus your penalty attempts.Consistency Heatmap: A GitHub-style activity tracker that weights squares by the difficulty (rating) of the problems solved, not just the quantity.📈 Growth & Prediction6-Month Growth Projection: Uses linear regression to predict your rating trajectory based on your last 180 days of activity.Smart Recommendations: Suggests the next 3 problems you should solve based on your weakest tags and current rating.💻 Tech StackLayerTechnologyFrontendReact.js, Tailwind CSS, Recharts (for data visualization)BackendNode.js, Express.jsDatabaseMongoDB (Caching API responses for performance)APICodeforces API
